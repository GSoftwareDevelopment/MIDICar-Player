In version 1.5

[ ] version designations in the program, so that there are no problems with distinguishing between them
[ ] possibility to determine the used driver from the command line
[ ] possibility to specify the file to be played from the command line
[ ] possibility to set the refresh rate of the screen content - currently it is set to every 3rd frame, which translates into smoother decoding of the MID stream
[ ] improved handling of track editing - currently, for lengths greater than 30 characters, it spoils the appearance of the screen :P
[ ] improvement of list handling - there was a bug, which, when the list is filled to the penultimate position, causes that, the list scrolls further :p
[ ] improvement of the progress bar - there are possible situations in which the bar is "broken", and its area is not cleared when it is launched
[ ] configuration file
