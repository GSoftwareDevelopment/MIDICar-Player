In version 1.5

1. [ ] version designations in the program, so that there are no problems with distinguishing between them

2. [ ] error when moving to the next track - when the next in the list is a catalogue, it moves to it and recursion occurs. An invalid path is created

3. [ ] improved handling of track editing - currently, for lengths greater than 30 characters, it spoils the appearance of the screen :P

4. [ ] improvement of list handling - there was a bug, which, when the list is filled to the penultimate position, causes that, the list scrolls further :p

5. [ ] improvement of the progress bar - there are possible situations in which the bar is "broken", and its area is not cleared when it is launched

6. [ ] possibility to determine the used driver from the command line

7. [ ] possibility to specify the file to be played from the command line

8. [ ] possibility to set the refresh rate of the screen content - currently it is set to every 3rd frame, which translates into smoother decoding of the MID stream

[ ] configuration file
