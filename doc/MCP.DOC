# Syntax

MCP [[D[n]:][path]midifile.ext] [/D[n]:[path]driver.ext] [/Rh] [/Ccolours] [/Shex]

Specifying a file specification results in it being passed on to the player, which then automatically loads and plays it. In this situation, the programme enters SINGLE-SONG mode.
The file browser is switched off.
The file specification, does not necessarily have to be at the beginning (as the first parameter) it may as well be at the end or between switches.

ONLY ONE file can be passed to the player.

# Switches

/D - specifies the MIDI driver file.

* IMPORTANT NOTE *
It is required to specify the full path to th driver file. The letter 'D' is both a switch and part of the device name. There is no support for a one-letter device specification, This must be specified as 'D1:' to 'DO:'.

/R - Allows you to specify, how often (every screen frame) the information will be refreshed.

/C - Defines the player colours.

Specify the hexadecimal values for the individual colour registers (708 to 712) as the 'colours' parameter. The first five numbers, specify the first set of colours, the next five, the second set.
Sets can be switched, using the * INVERS * key.

/S - Allows you to define your own SysEx message of the MIDI Reset type.

* QUICK NOTE *

This message is called every time the player stops playing. Its function is to reset the MIDI device, including muting the sounds played, channel settings, etc. etc.
The message definition consists of a sequence of bytes, represented in hexadecimal. In theory, this string can be up to 256 bytes long; in practice, this message should be no longer than a dozen bytes.
